# VBA Homework - The VBA of Wall Street

* In this challenge I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

### Files

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final report.

## Results

* A script that loops through all the stocks for one year for each run and takes the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* There is conditional formatting that highlights positive change in green and negative change in red.


### CHALLENGES

1. Your solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume". The solution will look as follows:


2. Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
